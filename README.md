A working sample concept of a Neural Network written in Python. No libraries are used besides basic, built-in ones. This project was made to showcase, in a simple way, the inner workings of an Artificial Neural Network. 

### Running the ANN

The Jupyter notebook contains snippets of code which can be used for quickly executing some sample runs of the ANN.
